Thank you to [Steven C Howell](https://twitter.com/StevenCHowell) for hosting a Bokeh tutorial at PyOhio 2017. A [video of the tutorial]() will be linked when posted by PhOhio.

The files contained here are slimmed down versions of what Steven presented, modified to serve as personal reference material. I strongly encourage you to check out his complete tutorial at [**pyohio_2017_bokeh**](https://github.com/StevenCHowell/pyohio_2017_bokeh), as well as the resources he cited in his [license](https://github.com/StevenCHowell/pyohio_2017_bokeh/blob/master/LICENSE).
